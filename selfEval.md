# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
I think im decently selfaware now with how I spend my time. Both in my productive struggles and where I spend my personal time. I think I should keep trying to be better about it as I've struggled with it before. I would say that the 40 minutes on, 20 minutes off rule works as long as I don't have any other commitments throughout the day.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
Functions are like any baking recipe, you give your computer instrcutions in how to make it and what to do, and then it can give you the desired dished/results you wanted. 


- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
To put it simply,

Parameters —> placeholders

Arguments —> actual data


- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?

I think that I would just like to see how everyone delt with functions and to compare what routes everyone went with.
